# Carbon Emissions Impact Analysis with Python

## Overview
This project analyzes the impact of carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions on global temperature anomalies using Python. The goal is to understand how rising CO₂ levels correlate with temperature changes and predict future impacts using statistical and machine learning models. The project also provides insights into emission trends over decades and their environmental consequences.

## Datasets Used
- **Temperature Anomalies Dataset**: Contains annual temperature changes across multiple countries and decades.
- **CO₂ Concentrations Dataset**: Monthly global atmospheric CO₂ levels over time.

## Features
- Data Loading and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Visualization
- Statistical Analysis
- Predictive Modeling

## Installation
To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/carbon-emissions-analysis.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd carbon-emissions-analysis

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the main Python script to perform the analysis:

```bash
python analysis.py
```

This will process the data, generate visualizations, and display insights into carbon emissions and their impact on temperature anomalies.

## Results & Insights
